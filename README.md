# Something Else

This project is written without any Kotlin, just to make it easy to use. But after programming with Kotlin for some time, writing pure Java really pains a little.

The idea to write this library is that, I could not find one library to complete the `Animated Strike Through Textview` task. So I have to build it from scratch.

Well that's not too much though, and the `Spotlight Effect` to be done. Welcome to create PRs.
